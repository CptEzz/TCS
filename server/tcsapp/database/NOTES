Primary key of Student and Class tables is ROWID, an unspecified colummn, an auto-incrementing
integer.

Based on tests, it has been gathered that if a mid-range entry (that it an entry with a ROWID
that is not the largest) is deleted, it will not be used again. However, if the latest entry
(the entry with the largest ROWID) is deleted, it will be used again.
